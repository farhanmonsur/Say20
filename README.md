How to play:

	 One may count upto one or two  numbers per turn, and the numbers must be in counting order.
   
	 One must start with the number after the last one that the other one said.
   
	 For example, the first person can say '1' or '1', '2'
   
	 If the first person says '1','2', then the second person could say '3' or '3','4' and so on.
   
	 The first one to say '20' will win the game.
